# CSC3020 Term Project - Soccer Team Stat Tracker

## Project Overview
This project is a web-based application designed to solve the problem of manually tracking and calculating soccer player statistics. It will allow a user (like a coach or team manager) to input player data, log stats from games (goals, assists, minutes played), and view an organized dashboard of individual and team performance metrics.
